# Network Issue Report - Next.js Not Serving

## Problem Summary
Next.js (and any Node.js server) reports "Ready" but doesn't actually listen on any port. This is a system-level issue, not a code issue.

## Symptoms
1. Next.js shows "✓ Ready in 1087ms" but connections fail
2. Basic Node.js HTTP servers also fail to accept connections
3. Tried ports: 3000, 5173, 8080 - all fail
4. Both localhost and 0.0.0.0 bindings fail
5. curl returns: "Failed to connect to localhost port X after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server"

## Tests Performed
1. ✅ Loopback interface (lo0) is UP and configured correctly
2. ✅ /etc/hosts file has correct localhost entries
3. ✅ No blocking firewall rules found with pfctl
4. ❌ Basic Node.js HTTP server fails to accept connections
5. ❌ Next.js dev server fails on all ports
6. ❌ Custom Next.js server with 0.0.0.0 binding fails

## Root Cause Possibilities
1. **macOS Security Software**: Some security software can block localhost connections
2. **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**: May be blocking network bindings
3. **Network Extension**: VPN or security software using network extensions
4. **Kernel Extension**: Low-level network filtering
5. **System Configuration**: Corrupted network stack configuration

## Immediate Workarounds
Since localhost connections are blocked at the system level, you have these options:

### Option 1: Use Network IP Instead
```bash
# Find your local network IP
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

# Start Next.js binding to your network IP
cd apps/web
HOSTNAME=192.168.1.219 PORT=3000 node server.js

# Access via: http://192.168.1.219:3000
```

### Option 2: Use Docker
```bash
# Create a Dockerfile for the web app
docker build -t pokemon-web ./apps/web
docker run -p 3000:3000 pokemon-web
```

### Option 3: Debug System Issue
1. Check Activity Monitor for security software
2. Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall
3. Run in Safe Mode to test
4. Check Console.app for network-related errors
5. Try creating a new user account to test

## Current Status
- API server likely has same issue (port 3001)
- Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.) work because they use Docker's network bridge
- This blocks all local development requiring localhost connections

## Next Steps
1. Try accessing via network IP (192.168.1.219) instead of localhost
2. Check for security software that might be blocking connections
3. Consider using Docker for all services
4. As a last resort, test in Safe Mode or new user account

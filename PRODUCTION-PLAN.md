### **🚨 Critical Issues**
1. **NextAuth OAuth Redirect Loop** ⚠️ **BLOCKING**
   - Google OAuth completes authentication but redirects back to signin page
   - Extensive debugging completed with multiple fix attempts
   - Environment variables verified in Vercel (NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL)
   - Database session strategy implemented with PrismaAdapter
   - VerificationToken table added to schema
   - **Impact**: Prevents testing of completed AI deck analysis features
   - **Debug Tools**: `/test-env`, `/auth-test-comprehensive`, `/debug-oauth` endpoints deployed

2. **TCGPlayer URL Completion** 📝 **IN PROGRESS**
   - Background script updating ~12,735 remaining cards with purchase links
   - Rate-limited by Pokemon TCG API (2-second delays between requests)
   - Does not affect core functionality, only user purchase experience

### **📅 Next Phase: AI Features Phase 2** (READY TO START)
**Prerequisites**: 
- ✅ Phase 1 deck analysis complete
- ⚠️ Fix NextAuth redirect loop for testing

1. **Collection-to-Deck Builder** (Week 3-4)
   - Filter deck suggestions by owned cards
   - Calculate deck completion percentage  
   - Budget optimization with price thresholds
   - Meta deck templates with cost analysis

2. **Smart Recommendation System** (Week 5-6)
   - Context-aware card suggestions
   - Synergy detection between cards
   - Meta-game awareness for competitive play

### **🔧 Immediate Action Items**
1. **CRITICAL**: Investigate NextAuth + Next.js 15 compatibility issues
2. Monitor TCGPlayer URL update completion (background process)
3. Plan Phase 2 implementation once auth is resolved

## 🔄 Migration to Stable Version

**As of June 20, 2025**, this production system is being replaced with a simplified architecture:

### Why We're Migrating
1. **Authentication Issues**: Better Auth incompatible with Next.js 15, causing OAuth redirect loops
2. **Complexity**: Three separate services (Vercel + Railway + Supabase) create unnecessary overhead
3. **Cost**: Current setup costs ~$65/month vs ~$25/month for simplified stack
4. **Maintenance**: GraphQL adds complexity without providing significant benefits for this use case

### New Architecture
- **Everything on Vercel**: Next.js 14 + Vercel Postgres + API Routes
- **Clerk for Auth**: Proven solution that "just works" with OAuth
- **No GraphQL**: Simple REST API with Next.js API routes
- **Same Features**: All functionality will be preserved

### Migration Resources
- 📋 [Migration Document](../pokemon-catalog-stable/MIGRATION.md) - All-in-one migration plan with progress tracking

**Note**: This system will remain operational during migration to ensure zero downtime.

# Step 1 Test Report - Pokemon Catalog Production

## ✅ Tests Completed

### 1. Dependencies Installation
- **Status**: ✅ Success
- **Details**: All packages installed correctly with pnpm
- **Warnings**: Some deprecated packages (expected with certain dependencies)

### 2. Project Structure
- **Status**: ✅ Success
- **Verified Files**:
  - ✅ Monorepo configuration (turbo.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml)
  - ✅ Next.js app structure (apps/web)
  - ✅ NestJS API structure (apps/api)
  - ✅ Prisma database package (packages/database)
  - ✅ Shared types package (packages/shared)
  - ✅ Docker Compose configuration

### 3. TypeScript Compilation
- **Status**: ✅ Success
- **Details**: TypeScript compiles without errors in shared package
- **Type safety**: All types properly exported and importable

### 4. Prisma Schema
- **Status**: ✅ Success
- **Verified Models**:
  - ✅ User (authentication)
  - ✅ Card (Pokemon cards)
  - ✅ Collection (user collections)
  - ✅ Deck (deck building)
  - ✅ Trade (trading system)
  - ✅ PriceHistory (price tracking)
  - ✅ All relationships properly defined

### 5. Turborepo Configuration
- **Status**: ✅ Success (after fix)
- **Fixed**: Updated `pipeline` to `tasks` for Turbo v2
- **Build pipeline**: Configured but apps don't have build scripts yet (expected)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Docker**: Not available in current environment
   - Docker Compose file is ready for local development
   - Will work when Docker is installed

2. **Database Connection**: No actual database running
   - Prisma schema is valid and generates client
   - Will connect when PostgreSQL is available

3. **Build Scripts**: Apps don't have full implementations yet
   - This is expected for Step 1 (foundation only)
   - Will be implemented in subsequent steps

## 📋 What We Should Test (But Can't in This Environment)

1. **Docker Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   # Would start PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
   ```

2. **Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   # Would create all tables in PostgreSQL
   ```

3. **Full Application Startup**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Would start both Next.js and NestJS apps
   ```

## 🎯 Step 1 Verification Summary

All foundational elements are properly in place:

1. ✅ **Monorepo Structure**: Turborepo configured with proper workspace setup
2. ✅ **Package Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
3. ✅ **Type Safety**: Shared types package working
4. ✅ **Database Schema**: Comprehensive Prisma schema ready
5. ✅ **Configuration**: Environment variables documented
6. ✅ **Documentation**: README, CLAUDE.md, and plan files created
7. ✅ **Version Control**: Git repository initialized with clean commit

## 🚀 Ready for Step 2

The foundation is solid and ready for:
- Authentication implementation (NextAuth.js)
- GraphQL resolver development
- Database migrations
- API endpoint creation
- Frontend component development

## 📝 Notes for Development

When you have Docker available, run:
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

The monorepo will handle:
- Shared type updates automatically
- Hot reloading across packages
- Parallel development of frontend/backend
- Centralized dependency management

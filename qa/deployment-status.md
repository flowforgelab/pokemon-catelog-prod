# Phase 1 Deployment Status

## Current Infrastructure ✅
- **API**: https://pokemon-catelog-prod-production.up.railway.app (LIVE)
- **Frontend**: https://pokemon-catelog-prod.vercel.app (LIVE)  
- **Database**: Supabase with 18,555 cards (CONNECTED)

## Production Test Results

### ✅ API Health Check
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "cardCount": 18555
}
```

### ✅ GraphQL Public Queries Working
- Total cards: 18,555
- Search functionality: Working
- Pricing data: Available (93% coverage)

### ❌ Phase 1 Features Not Yet Deployed
The new deck analysis features are not deployed to Railway yet:
- `analyzeDeck` mutation
- `deckRecommendations` query
- `DeckAnalyzerService`
- `RecommendationService`

## Deployment Steps Required

1. **Deploy API Changes to Railway**
```bash
# From apps/api directory
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add deck analysis and recommendations"
git push origin main
```

2. **Railway Will Auto-Deploy**
- Railway detects push to main branch
- Builds with Nixpacks
- Deploys new version

3. **Verify Deployment**
- Check Railway dashboard for build status
- Test new mutations in production

## Test Data Ready
We have 5 test decks in production database:
- Empty: `70ad357e-2c12-49a4-a26d-f026a5753b45`
- Aggro: `e907402d-a074-4453-acf1-ad1f303d4602`
- Control: `be45a5f4-2dea-4d8e-beb0-c8157d467365`
- 4-Card Rule: `e9940dd1-0486-47c9-873e-1bcf807b7532`
- Multi-Type: `652d7a49-c5bd-4454-bffd-dbd5902658bc`

## Summary
- ✅ Production infrastructure is healthy
- ✅ Test data is ready in production
- ❌ Phase 1 code needs deployment
- ⏳ UI components need deployment after API

**Next Action**: Deploy the Phase 1 changes to Railway

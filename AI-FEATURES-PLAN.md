# Pokemon TCG AI Features Implementation Plan

## Overview
A cost-effective, 6-phase implementation plan for AI-powered Pokemon TCG features that maximizes rule-based analysis while strategically using LLMs for complex insights.

## Core Philosophy
- **Rule-Based First**: Use deterministic analysis for 80% of features
- **AI Enhancement**: Apply LLMs selectively for complex strategy insights
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize API calls through intelligent caching and batching
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build foundational features before advanced AI

## Phase 1: Rule-Based Deck Analysis Engine
**Timeline: Week 1-2**
**Cost: $0 (no AI usage)**

### Features
- **Deck Type Classification**: Identify strategy based on card composition
  - Aggro (low-cost attackers, quick setup)
  - Control (high HP, stall tactics, energy denial)
  - Combo (specific card synergies, setup-dependent)
  - Midrange (balanced approach)

- **Basic Deck Health Metrics**
  - Energy curve analysis (optimal 12-16 basic energy)
  - Pokemon ratio validation (8-12 Pokemon recommended)
  - Trainer card distribution (20-30 trainers optimal)
  - Win condition identification

- **Rule-Based Recommendations**
  - Energy type consistency warnings
  - Deck size optimization (60 cards exactly)
  - Basic compliance checks (4-card rule)
  - Format legality validation

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Deck analysis engine
interface DeckAnalysis {
  strategy: 'aggro' | 'control' | 'combo' | 'midrange'
  energyCurve: number[]
  consistency: number // 0-100 score
  recommendations: string[]
  warnings: string[]
}

class DeckAnalyzer {
  analyzeStrategy(cards: Card[]): string {
    const avgManaCost = calculateAverageCost(cards)
    const aggresiveCards = countAggressiveCards(cards)
    // Rule-based classification logic
  }
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE deck_analyses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  deck_id UUID REFERENCES decks(id),
  strategy VARCHAR(20),
  consistency_score INTEGER,
  energy_curve JSONB,
  recommendations JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Phase 2: Collection-to-Deck Builder with Pricing
**Timeline: Week 3-4**
**Cost: $0 (uses existing TCGPlayer data)**

### Features
- **Owned Card Deck Builder**
  - Filter deck suggestions by owned cards
  - Calculate deck completion percentage
  - Show missing cards with purchase costs

- **Budget Optimization**
  - "Cheapest competitive deck" generator
  - Price threshold filtering ($50, $100, $200 budgets)
  - Alternative card suggestions (budget replacements)

- **Meta Deck Templates**
  - Popular deck archetypes with card lists
  - Owned vs missing card breakdown
  - Total completion cost calculation

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface DeckRecommendation {
  name: string
  strategy: string
  totalCost: number
  ownedCards: Card[]
  missingCards: Array<{
    card: Card
    quantity: number
    cost: number
    alternatives?: Card[]
  }>
  completionPercentage: number
}

class CollectionDeckBuilder {
  generateBudgetDecks(collection: Card[], maxBudget: number): DeckRecommendation[] {
    // Rule-based deck generation from owned cards
  }
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE deck_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  strategy VARCHAR(20),
  card_list JSONB, -- [{cardId, quantity}]
  estimated_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
  win_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
  popularity_score INTEGER
);
```

---

## Phase 3: Smart Recommendation System  
**Timeline: Week 5-6**
**Cost: ~$10-20/month (limited AI usage)**

### Features
- **Intelligent Card Suggestions**
  - Context-aware recommendations based on deck strategy
  - Synergy detection between cards
  - Meta-game awareness (popular cards in similar decks)

- **Upgrade Path Analysis**
  - Identify weakest cards in current deck
  - Suggest specific improvements with reasoning
  - Priority ranking for upgrades

- **Anti-Meta Suggestions**
  - Identify popular opponent strategies
  - Recommend counter-cards and tech choices
  - Format-specific adjustments

### AI Integration Strategy
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple decks simultaneously
- **Caching**: Store similar deck analysis results
- **Selective AI**: Only use LLM for complex card interactions

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface CardRecommendation {
  suggestedCard: Card
  replacementFor?: Card
  reasoning: string
  synergies: string[]
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  costDelta: number
}

class SmartRecommendationEngine {
  async generateRecommendations(deck: Deck): Promise<CardRecommendation[]> {
    // Rule-based filtering first
    const candidates = this.ruleBased.getCandidates(deck)
    
    // AI enhancement for top candidates only
    if (candidates.length > 10) {
      return await this.ai.rankRecommendations(candidates.slice(0, 10))
    }
    
    return candidates
  }
}
```

class AIAnalysisManager {
  private cache = new Map<string, AnalysisResult>()
  
  async analyzeCardSynergies(cards: Card[]): Promise<SynergyAnalysis> {
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(cards)
    
    if (this.cache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return this.cache.get(cacheKey)
    }
    
    // Batch multiple requests
    const result = await this.batchAnalyze([cards])
    this.cache.set(cacheKey, result)
    
    return result
  }
  
  private async batchAnalyze(cardSets: Card[][]): Promise<AnalysisResult[]> {
    // Send multiple deck analyses in single API call
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 5: Chat Interface with Intent Recognition

### Cost Optimization Strategy
```typescript
class ChatManager {
  async processMessage(message: string, context: UserContext): Promise<string> {
    // Rule-based intent classification first
    const intent = this.classifyIntent(message)
    
    switch (intent) {
      case 'simple_question':
        return this.ruleBasedResponse(message, context)
      case 'complex_strategy':
        return await this.aiEnhancedResponse(message, context)
      case 'deck_building':
        return this.deckBuilderResponse(message, context)
    }
  }
  
  private classifyIntent(message: string): Intent {
    // Use simple keyword matching and patterns first
    // Only use AI for ambiguous cases
  }
